**ðŸ“Š Cloud Resume Challenge - Manoj**

Live Site: https://dlrl2fxutn5w1.cloudfront.net/

Created on: June 18, 2025

**Project Overview**

This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, designed to showcase my practical skills in Cloud, DevOps, and Serverless technologies.
The site is a static resume hosted on S3, secured via CloudFront, and includes a serverless visitor counter using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

**How It Works**
