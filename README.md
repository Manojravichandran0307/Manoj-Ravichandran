 Project Overview

This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, designed to showcase my practical skills in Cloud, DevOps, and Serverless technologies.
The site is a static resume hosted on S3, secured via CloudFront, and includes a serverless visitor counter using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
